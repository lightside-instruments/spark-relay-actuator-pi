spark-relay-actuator-pi is a hardware platform for managed
relay actuator implementation controlled over Raspberry Pi
compatible 40 pin interface. The design is inspired by 
the Spark hardware platform for networking as form factor
but with a Raspberry Pi 40 pin connector as management
interface instead of 96boards.

The functionality is similar to the two-position relay
actuators of the classical HP 59306A. The device falls
into the IVI Switch instrument class abstraction model.

The project includes schematic and PCB
design files for KiCAD and technical documentation for
production of a 19 inch rack mountable ESD Acrylic box.
