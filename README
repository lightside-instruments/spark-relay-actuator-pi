spark4pi-* is a modular hardware platform for managed
instrument implementations controlled over Raspberry Pi
compatible 40 pin interface. The design is inspired by 
the Spark hardware platform for networking as form factor
but with a Raspberry Pi 40 pin connector as management
interface instead of 96boards.

The functionality of spark4pi-relay-actuator
is similar to the two-position relay
actuators of the classical HP 59306A but with 3 relays
instead of 6. The device falls into the IVI Switch instrument
class abstraction model.

The project includes schematic and PCB
design files for KiCAD and technical documentation for
production of a 19 inch rack mountable ESD Acrylic box.
It also includes pi-bridge board design file that
connects together a Pi compatible board with the instrument
extension base board mounted to the left of the
Pi compatible control board.
